# My first project outside of codecademy

### Intro
Mixed Messages will generate a new random message every time the user asks it to. For now I am writing minimal code to get the functionality and practicing making commits to get a feel for everything.

### Languages
This program will use JS and possibly some HTMl/CSS if it's not pretty enough.

### Programming
In Mixed Messages I will use arrays of _nouns_, _adjectives_ and _verbs_ to randomly input into multiple pre-written texts. I have not decided on the topic yet. Will update as we go.

### Types of Messages
I would like the main theme to be comedy. Let's try to not get too offensive here.
-Astrology
-Paramedicine
-Daily life with a dog
